# What-Is-The-BPM

This App is now deprecated, please see the newer version written in C# [HERE](https://github.com/nzbasic/WhatsTheBpm)

This program displays the current BPM you are streaming or tapping at for osu. It also displays the current BPM of the map you are playing as a target, using data collected from a process memory finder.\
See these awesome projects: [cadon0 ProcessMemoryDataFinder](https://github.com/cadon0/ProcessMemoryDataFinder) and [Piotrekol ProcessMemoryDataFinder](https://github.com/Piotrekol/ProcessMemoryDataFinder) (Required to run the app)

To run the WIP version of the app, you must download cadon0's processmemorydatafinder exe and place it in the resources folder of the source code. Specifically resources/org/WhatIsTheBpm/GifToTheBeatDataProvider.exe\
Libraries needed: jnativehook-2.1.0, org.json, javafx(version14)\
Pom file for the maven project libraries is in the source code.
